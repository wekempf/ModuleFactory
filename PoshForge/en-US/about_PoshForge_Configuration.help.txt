SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PoshForge uses a flexible configuration system to allow customization of how commands behave.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    PoshForge can be configured to use certain values for parameters not explicitly specified by creating a Configuration.psd1 in one of the directories returned by Get-PoshForgeConfigurationPath. Configuration values are obtained by merging the Configuration.psd1 in each of the configuration directories in the Scope order of Enterprise, Machine, User.

    Plaster templates used by the various commands can be customized by creating a template in a template directory in one of the configuration directories returned by Configuration.psd1.

    Code can be run before a template is is invoked by creating a Pre{TemplateName}.ps1 file in a hooks directory in one of the configuration directories returned by Configuration.psd1.

    Code can be run after a template is is invoked by creating a {TemplateName}.ps1 file in a hooks directory in one of the configuration directories returned by Configuration.psd1.
